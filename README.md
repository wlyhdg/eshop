# eshop
Taking a poke at a quick e-commerce project. Worked on Python 3 and Django skills, interfacing with third-party interface (Stripe charge API), and api creation.

In the eshop > src directory run:

  `python manage.py runserver <desired port [default: 8000]`

open up your browser and enjoy the mock shopping.

Ideas to add:
- shopping cart
- totals/ checkout
